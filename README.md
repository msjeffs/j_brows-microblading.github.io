# j_brows-microblading.github.io

### Project Vision
The website will allow potential customers to:
  1. Follow a ["Mobile First" Design](https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00) and a Multi Page Web Application Design
  2. Learn more about [Microblading Eyebrows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblading)
  3. Learn about the J_Brows Microblading and its mission to increase confidence one's self
  4. View J_Brows Microblading's past work through social media and eventually a gallery
  5. Be able contact J_Brows to set up an appointment

### Success Criteria
 The complete product will be realized once the website is operational and J_Brows is able to direct
 future customers to the website and book an appointment.

### Stakeholders
 The invested parties include the J_Brows Microblading and the 2 web developers responsible for the project

### Project Risks
 Potential Risks involved in the project could be the technical debt regarding:
  1. Website load time may take more than 5 seconds to load due
  2. Web Developers are relatively new to DevOps concepts
  3. The single page web application design while simple will be more challenging when implementing SEO

### Responsibilities
Both Web Developers will work to push any code with a message of what they added or update. Updates will be communicated before done. Web Developers must estimate the hours they put in each week.
